This file is to understand how dialogue.txt works and how to split the file to get the correct information

background info:

the purpose of the dialogue file is to load in dialogue as well as the titles of tutorial sections inside of the tutorial page.

How it works:

.each line of the text file is a seperate piece of information

.if you dont detect a ':' character on a line then this means the following text on that line is the title of the next chapter of tutorial sections

.if you do detect a ':'character then split that line by the ':' character, put it in an array and you should get returned a list with 3 elements in the following order
     
    .the first element in the list is the title of the section 
    .the second is the text that will be displayed
    .the third is a FEN string that will be the board to be displayed so the user can try out moving the piece
