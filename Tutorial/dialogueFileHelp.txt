This file is to understand how dialogue.txt works and how to split the file to get the correct information

background info:

the purpose of the dialogue file is to load in dialogue as well as the titles of tutorial sections inside of the tutorial page.

How it works:

.Each line of the text file is a seperate section of tutorial

.Each section of tutorial should be split by the ':' character

.These sections are the [Title of the section,Text to show user when clicked,FEN string that is loaded into the game when practicing what you've learned]

.example of a possible line --> 'Lesson ?? - XXXXX:BLAHBLAHBLAH:rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1:'
