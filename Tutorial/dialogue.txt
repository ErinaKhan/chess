THE BASICS
Lesson 1 - Pawn:It is not a minor or major player but can be useful depending on your pawn moves. It moves vertically forward one vacant square, with the option two squares forward if they have not yet moved and the squares are vacant.:rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1:
Lesson 2 - Queen:The strongest and most important player. It can move diagonally, horizontally or vertically of unoccupied squares.:rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1:
Lesson 3 - Knight:The knight moves in "L" or "7" form. It moves one square horizontally or vertically, then two squares in a horizontal or vertical direction. It has the ability to fork the opponent's pieces. Forking means attacking two or more pieces simultaneously.:rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1:
Lesson 4 - King:The King is not the strongest. It can move one square at a time, in any direction. Although the victory or loss at the game depends on which side has their King by the end.:rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1:
Lesson 5 - Bishop:The minor piece. It is capable of diagonal movement for any number of vacant squares. A pair of bishops is much stronger than a Bishop and a Knight.:rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1:
Lesson 6 - Rook:The second strongest and important player. It moves vertically and horizontally on any number of vacant squares.:rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1:
Lesson 7 - Checkmate:What is a CHECKMATE? when a KING is attacked, it is called a CHECK. A CHECKMATE occurs when a KING is placed in check and has no legal moves to escape. When a CHECKMATE happens, the game ends immediately, and the player who delivered the checkmate wins.:rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1:
TECHNIQUES
Lesson 8 - Pin:A Pin is a tactic, that allows you to restrict one or more pieces that your opponent has. You can do this by attacking the other player forces in a way that allows you to explore a much greater vulnerability if the attacked pieces moves. Most of the time the piece blocks an attack to a more valuable piece, but it could also protect a key defender of the position or even impede a checkmate:rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1:
Lesson 9 - Fork:A fork is a tactic that consists of a single piece attacking two or more pieces at the same time. The attacking piece is known as the forking piece, while the attacked pieces are known as the forked pieces.:rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1:
Lesson 10 - Battery:A battery is when you put two pieces on the same row or diagonal to apply pressure on a piece. (This is usually with two rooks or a bishop and queen):rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1:
SPECIAL MOVES
Lesson 11 - En Passant:En Passant is a special move in chess where if your pawn is on the 5th row and an enemy pawn moves two squares on one of the adjacent rows you can take it diagonally despite the pawn being next to your piece. (can only do directly after there pawn move):rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1:
Lesson 12 - Castling:If you haven't moved your king or rook during the game and all squares are clear between the king and rook you can castle on that side which swaps the pieces around keeping your king safe:rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1:
Lesson 13 - Promotion:If you are able to get a pawn to the otherside of the board you can turn you piece into any other major piece (queen,knight,rook,bishop):rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1:
